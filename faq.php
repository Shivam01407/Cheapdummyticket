                        <span>The term "dummy ticket" is another synonym for "flight reservation," which refers to booking  flight

                            Low-Cost-Carrier (LCC) and regular airlines are the two main categories of airlines.
                            Making a dummy ticket is not possible when flying with a low-cost carrier, but it is doable when flying with another airline.
                            Dummy ticket airlines are hence another term for LCC airlines.
                            Air India, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, Air Canada, British Airways, Air France, Emirates, Etihad, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and others are a few of them.
                            Indigo, GoAir, Air Asia, Air Arabia, and other LCCs are a few examples.
