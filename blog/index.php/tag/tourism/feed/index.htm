<p>This is the common question? from which every outbound traveler came across.</p>



<h2>Can we consider a dummy return ticket to show as a proof of return?</h2>



<p>Technically the answer is no, but people do &amp; it work for them.</p>



<p><strong>(Here&#8217;s why)<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>



<h3>First, let&#8217;s make it clear what a dummy ticket actually is?</h3>



<ul><li>In very simple definition, dummy tickets are those tickets which are yet to be issued and hold for a particular time of period.</li><li>The dummy ticket is usually used to fulfil the documentation requirements for visa application.</li><li>On the other hand, Proof of return is considered as a confirmed return ticket which is fully paid.</li></ul>

<h3>Let&#8217;s deeply understand…</h3>



<p>What actually happens when a person travels internationally.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2708.png" alt="✈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<ul><li>He/she should need to cross immigration counter twice in the journey, first when he leaves his home country and second when he reaches his destination country.</li><li>In these immigration counters, the person should show the proof of return which is confirmed return tickets.</li><li>In this case, people need to buy an actual ticket and then after reaching the destination they can cancel the ticket.</li><li>However, what do people usually do? They bought a dummy ticket for proof of return to escape the huge expenses.</li><li>Because the dummy tickets and actual flight tickets look almost similar. The only exception is dummy tickets do not mention E-Ticket numbers but on Genuine  flight tickets E-Ticket number is mentioned.</li><li>And usually the immigration official does not check in very detail which ticket you hold. In the 99 percent cases, the probability is high that a person crosses the immigration with a dummy ticket without facing any issue.</li><li>But in 1 percent possibility, if they find that you haven&#8217;t a Genuine  flight ticket.</li><li>Either they will not give you permission to cross the immigration counter and deboard you or they will allow you to continue to travel.</li><li>Hence, this is the whole scenario. Even after knowing this if you want to buy a dummy ticket then we are available 24×7 for you at a very reasonable and affordable price.</li></ul>
