<p>This is the common question? from which every outbound traveler came across.</p>



<h2>Can we consider a dummy return ticket to show as a proof of return?</h2>



<p>Technically the answer is no, but people do &amp; it work for them.</p>



<p><strong>(Here&#8217;s why)<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>



<h3>First, let&#8217;s make it clear what a dummy ticket actually is?</h3>



<ul><li>In very simple definition, dummy tickets are those tickets which are yet to be issued and hold for a particular time of period.</li><li>The dummy ticket is usually used to fulfil the documentation requirements for visa application.</li><li>On the other hand, Proof of return is considered as a confirmed return ticket which is fully paid.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="800" height="800" src="https://dummy-tickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dummy-Return-Ticket-For-Proof-of-Return-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-66" srcset="https://dummy-tickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dummy-Return-Ticket-For-Proof-of-Return-1.png 800w, https://dummy-tickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dummy-Return-Ticket-For-Proof-of-Return-1-300x300.png 300w, https://dummy-tickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dummy-Return-Ticket-For-Proof-of-Return-1-150x150.png 150w, https://dummy-tickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dummy-Return-Ticket-For-Proof-of-Return-1-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>Let&#8217;s deeply understand…</h3>



<p>What actually happens when a person travels internationally.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2708.png" alt="✈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<ul><li>He/she should need to cross immigration counter twice in the journey, first when he leaves his home country and second when he reaches his destination country.</li><li>In these immigration counters, the person should show the proof of return which is confirmed return tickets.</li><li>In this case, people need to buy an actual ticket and then after reaching the destination they can cancel the ticket.</li><li>However, what do people usually do? They bought a dummy ticket for proof of return to escape the huge expenses.</li><li>Because the dummy tickets and actual flight tickets look almost similar. The only exception is dummy tickets do not mention E-Ticket numbers but on Genuine  flight tickets E-Ticket number is mentioned.</li><li>And usually the immigration official does not check in very detail which ticket you hold. In the 99 percent cases, the probability is high that a person crosses the immigration with a dummy ticket without facing any issue.</li><li>But in 1 percent possibility, if they find that you haven&#8217;t a Genuine  flight ticket.</li><li>Either they will not give you permission to cross the immigration counter and deboard you or they will allow you to continue to travel.</li><li>Hence, this is the whole scenario. Even after knowing this if you want to buy a dummy ticket then we are available 24×7 for you at a very reasonable and affordable price.</li></ul>



<p>There are a lot of dummy ticket generators who provide you fake dummy tickets which have invalid PNR. But our dummy tickets are genuine. You can also cross check at the airline website with the help of the given PNR Code.</p>
